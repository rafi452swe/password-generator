## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install Python  
2. Download this project  
3. Run this command in terminal:


python password_generator.py

```python
# How It Works:

# The program uses string.ascii_letters, string.digits, 
# and string.punctuation to create a pool of characters

# random.choice() picks characters from the pool 
# until the password reaches the desired length

# The password is displayed to the user
